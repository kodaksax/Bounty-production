# BOUNTYExpo Brand Voice Guidelines

## Overview

## Personality

Think of BOUNTYExpo as a **helpful guide** who:
- Anticipates questions and provides helpful context
- Celebrates progress and accomplishments
- Removes friction and confusion
- Builds confidence through clarity
- Respects users' time and intelligence

**NOT** as someone who:
- Commands or demands
- Uses jargon without explanation
- Leaves users guessing
- Sounds robotic or automated
- Talks down to users

## Writing Principles

### 1. Be Clear and Specific
- Use concrete language over abstract concepts
- Explain unfamiliar terms (e.g., "What is escrow?")
- Lead with the benefit, not the feature

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Earn money on your schedule"
- ❌ "Flexible earning opportunities"
- ✅ "Review applications, pick your helper, and chat directly"
- ❌ "Manage applicants efficiently"

### 2. Make It Actionable
- Button labels should describe the action or outcome
- Empty states should suggest next steps
- Error messages should guide recovery

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Create Your First Bounty"
- ❌ "Get Started"
- ✅ "Retry Connection"
- ❌ "OK"

### 3. Build Trust Through Transparency
- Explain why we need information
- Be upfront about processes (like escrow)
- Use precise language for financial matters
- Acknowledge when something goes wrong

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Phone verification adds an extra layer of security"
- ❌ "Verify your phone"
- ✅ "Once the work is done, release payment with one tap"
- ❌ "Complete transaction"

### 4. Show Progress and Achievement
- Celebrate completions
- Use encouraging language
- Acknowledge effort

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Complete your first bounty to see it here!"
- ❌ "No completed bounties"
- ✅ "You're all set! Start exploring bounties"
- ❌ "Setup complete"

## Content Types

### Empty States
**Purpose**: Encourage action, reduce friction, provide clear next steps

**Formula**: [Context] + [Encouraging statement] + [Clear CTA]

**Examples**:
- "No open bounties yet. Browse available opportunities or create your first bounty!"
- "No active work. Accept a bounty to get started!"
- "No completed bounties yet. Complete your first bounty to see it here!"

### Button Labels
**Purpose**: Clarify action, communicate value, build confidence

**Formula**: [Action Verb] + [Object/Benefit]

**Examples**:
- "Post Bounty" (not "Submit")
- "Send Message" (not "Send")
- "Update Profile" (not "Save")
- "Add Payment Method" (not "Add Card")
- "Release Payment" (not "Confirm")

### Error Messages
**Purpose**: Explain what happened, provide recovery path, maintain trust

**Formula**: [What happened] + [Why it matters] + [What to do]

**Examples**:
- "Connection lost. Your messages are saved and will send when you're back online. [Retry Now]"
- "Image too large. Maximum size is 5MB. Try a smaller image or compress it first."
- "Failed to load bounties. Check your connection and try again. [Retry]"

### Onboarding & Value Propositions
**Purpose**: Communicate benefits, build excitement, establish trust

**Key Messages**:
- For Posters: "Get tasks done faster" + "Pay only for completed work"
- For Hunters: "Earn money on your schedule" + "Guaranteed payment"
- For Everyone: "Payments protected by escrow" + "Verified profiles & ratings"

**Examples**:
- "The trusted marketplace for getting things done. Post a task, find local help, and pay safely — all in one place."
- "Review applications, pick your helper, and chat directly. Coordinate details, timing, and expectations — all within the app."
- "Funds are held in escrow until you confirm — your money is always protected."

### Tooltips & Help Text
**Purpose**: Explain unfamiliar concepts, provide context, reduce confusion

**Formula**: [Simple definition] + [Why it matters]

**Examples**:
- "**Escrow**: Your payment is held securely until you confirm the work is complete. This protects both you and the hunter."
- "**Honor Bounties**: Non-paid tasks that build reputation and help the community."
- "**Phone Verification**: Adds an extra layer of security and builds trust in the community."

## Tone Modifiers by Context

### Success/Completion
- Celebratory but not over-the-top
- Acknowledge achievement
- Encourage next steps

**Examples**:
- "Bounty completed! Payment released to [Hunter Name]."
- "Profile updated successfully!"
- "Welcome to BOUNTYExpo! Let's get you started."

### Errors/Problems
- Empathetic but not apologetic
- Clear about what happened
- Solution-focused

**Examples**:
- "Connection lost. Your work is saved and will sync when you're back online."
- "Payment method declined. Try another card or contact your bank."
- "Something went wrong. We're working on it. Please try again in a moment."

### Neutral/Informational
- Straightforward and clear
- Respectful of user's time
- Helpful without being condescending

**Examples**:
- "Verified profiles have completed phone verification"
- "Funds are held in escrow until you release payment"
- "Messages are end-to-end encrypted"

- "Synergistic collaboration"

### ❌ Over-Casualness
- "Yo, what's up!"
- "Oops, my bad!"
- "Nailed it! 🎉🔥💯"
