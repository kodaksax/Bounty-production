                <h2>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
                <p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
                
                <h3>Account and Profile</h3>
                <p>Name, username, email address, phone number (optional, private), profile photo, location you provide, and settings.</p>

                <h3>Payment and Transaction</h3>
                <p>We integrate with Stripe and Apple Pay. We do not store full payment card numbers. We may receive limited payment metadata from Stripe (for example: last four digits, brand, expiration month/year, billing zip) and transaction identifiers needed to operate escrow and payouts.</p>

                <h3>Location</h3>
                <p>Precise or approximate location if you grant permission (foreground or background) to support nearby bounty discovery and distance calculations. You can disable or remove permission in your device settings and in the app's Location & Visibility settings.</p>

                <h3>Device and Usage</h3>
                <p>Device type, OS version, app version, identifiers (for example, a push token), logs and diagnostics, and in-app actions needed to secure and improve the Services.</p>

                <h3>Communications and Content</h3>
                <p>Messages you send in the app (for example, chat content), support emails, and feedback.</p>

                <h3>Sources of Information</h3>
                <p>You (when you create an account or use the app), your device, and our service providers (for example, payment processors). We do not buy data and we do not collect from data brokers.</p>
