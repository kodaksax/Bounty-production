## Supabase CLI config
# This file was intentionally left minimal to avoid CLI parsing errors.
# The `supabase` CLI can be pointed to a project using `--project-ref`
# or by running `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` which will create
# a proper local config. If you need to store a project ref here,
# ensure it matches the CLI's expected format.

# NOTE: Do not add a top-level [project] table here unless it matches
# the supabase CLI schema — an invalid key will cause `supabase` to
# fail with "has invalid keys: project".
