Last updated October 18, 2025

This Privacy Notice for Bounty finder (doing business as "Bounty") describes how and why we access, collect, store, use, and/or share ("process") your personal information when you use our mobile Services.

Questions or concerns? Reading this Privacy Notice will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services. Contact us at Support@bountyfinder.app.

WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

We collect the following categories of information:

Account and Profile: name, username, email address, phone number (optional, private), profile photo, location you provide, and settings.

Payment and Transaction: we integrate with Stripe and Apple Pay. We do not store full payment card numbers. We may receive limited payment metadata from Stripe (for example: last four digits, brand, expiration month/year, billing zip) and transaction identifiers needed to operate escrow and payouts.

Location: precise or approximate location if you grant permission (foreground or background) to support nearby bounty discovery and distance calculations. You can disable or remove permission in your device settings and in the app's Location & Visibility settings.

Device and Usage: device type, OS version, app version, identifiers (for example, a push token), logs and diagnostics, and in-app actions needed to secure and improve the Services.

Communications and Content: messages you send in the app (for example, chat content), support emails, and feedback.

Sources of information: you (when you create an account or use the app), your device, and our service providers (for example, payment processors). We do not buy data and we do not collect from data brokers.

HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

We process information to:
- provide and operate the Services (account, authentication, matchmaking, chat, escrow and payouts)
- maintain safety, security, fraud prevention, and integrity of the platform
- send important notices (changes to terms, security, transactions)
- provide support and respond to requests
- improve performance, reliability, and user experience
- comply with law and enforce our terms

THIRD-PARTY PROCESSORS

We use trusted processors to run key parts of the Service. They process your information on our behalf under agreements that require appropriate safeguards.

- Supabase (authentication, database, storage). Privacy: https://supabase.com/privacy
- Stripe and Stripe Connect (payments, escrow, payouts, KYC as applicable). Privacy: https://stripe.com/privacy
- Apple Pay (Apple Payments tokens on supported devices). Privacy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-pay/

We do not sell or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

WHEN DO WE SHARE INFORMATION?

- With processors listed above
- With other users as necessary to operate a bounty (for example, your username and profile; your phone number is never public)
- For legal reasons (to comply with law, enforce terms, protect users)
- In connection with a corporate transaction (merger or acquisition)

COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES (MOBILE)

We are currently mobile only. We do not use web cookies for the app experience. The app may use device identifiers and SDK storage (for example, a push token) to deliver functionality, security, and notifications. You can:
- control push notifications in your device settings
- control location permissions in your device settings and in-app Location & Visibility
- we do not use advertising SDKs for behavioral ads

HOW LONG DO WE KEEP INFORMATION?

We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, including maintaining transaction records for compliance and accounting, resolving disputes, and enforcing agreements. When no longer needed, we delete or de-identify data.

HOW DO WE KEEP INFORMATION SAFE?

We implement technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk (for example, encryption in transit, access controls). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

CHILDREN

Our Services are intended for users 18+. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18.
