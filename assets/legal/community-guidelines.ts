Welcome to Bounty! Our community thrives on trust, respect, and safety. These guidelines help ensure everyone has a positive experience.

🤝 RESPECT & PROFESSIONALISM

Be Kind: Treat all community members with respect. Harassment, bullying, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind is not tolerated.

Communicate Clearly: Use polite, professional language in all interactions. Avoid offensive, threatening, or inappropriate content.

Honor Commitments: If you accept a bounty, do your best to complete it. If you post a bounty, respond to applicants promptly and fairly.

🛡️ SAFETY FIRST

Protect Your Personal Information: Never share sensitive personal information (home address, financial details, Social Security numbers) outside the app's secure channels.

Meet Safely: If a bounty requires in-person interaction, meet in public places, tell someone where you're going, and trust your instincts.

Use In-App Payments: Always use Bounty's built-in payment and escrow system. Never send money outside the app or agree to alternative payment methods.

Report Suspicious Activity: If something feels wrong, report it immediately. We take all reports seriously.

🚫 PROHIBITED CONTENT & BEHAVIOR

Spam & Scams: Do not post repetitive, misleading, or fraudulent bounties. Attempting to scam other users will result in immediate account termination.

💰 FAIR TRANSACTIONS

Clear Descriptions: Provide detailed, accurate bounty descriptions including scope, requirements, and timeline.
